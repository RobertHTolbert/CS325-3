<h2>Get to the portal, Burt!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Green Shirt Burt loves to go through portals, but this one is too high.  Help him find a way up to it.  
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want my players to think through basic physics and real world knowledge, such as using things to stand on to reach other things.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
The game is a simple block puzzle / physics game.  
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player can perform basic movement and jumping actions with the direction arrows on the keyboard.  The core mechanic is the animated sprite, which walks realistically.  Push left and right arrows to move left and right, and push the up arrow while on the ground to jump.  The core mechanic is pushing a block so that you can stand on it and jump on top of another block.  
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This prototype is evaluating the block-pushing mechanic.  Future goals are a way to pick up blocks and carry them.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Green Shirt Burt's sprite is a unique development based on video of a human walking, based on no prior sprites.  Additionally this game features realistic 'push things' physics. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game is abstract, but is interesting because of the detailed 'walksprite' and the simple physics puzzle.  
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
This game has no story.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
I am trying to reach simpleminded first graders with this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
This game takes less than one minute to play.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players should push the small block near the large floating block, so that they can stand on it to jump onto the big block and reach the portal.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All Assets were made from scratch aside from the cheering sound, which is from http://soundbible.com/2103-1-Person-Cheering.html
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I borrowed from no Phaser example.  This game most closely resembles early block-moving games like Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.
